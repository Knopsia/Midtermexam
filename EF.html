        All too frequently, common sense takes a holiday with a cellphone in hand.
        <br><br>
        According to the National Safety Council, an estimated 1.6 million accidents occur
        annually as distracted drivers text. The University of North Texas Health Science
        Center has determined 16,141 deaths occurred as a result of texting while driving.
        Those are frightening statistics for anyone on the road who could become the victim
        of such wanton negligence.
        <br><br>
        But the dangers in the digital divide don’t stop there. In this Age of Internet
        Narcissism, dozens of deaths annually have been attributed to selfies — selfportraits using cellphones often taken in unusual circumstances.
        <br><br>
        A North Carolina driver was killed when she crashed into a truck while posting a
        selfie of herself singing Pharrell Williams’ “Happy.” A pilot in Colorado lost control of
        his Cessna 150, killing himself and his passenger. A Puerto Rican musician died
        while taking a selfie on a motorcycle. A Polish couple crossed a safety barrier and
        fell off a cliff in Portugal while taking a selfie as their children watched.
        Several instances of “death by selfie” occurred while the photographer inadvertently
        pulled the trigger of a loaded gun in the other hand.
        Selfie sticks also figure in the carnage. One person was killed when he was struck
        by lightning. Another died after climbing atop a train when his selfie stick touched a
        high-voltage wire.
        <br><br>
        Russia announced a public campaign against selfies in dangerous situations after 10
        reported deaths and 100 injuries this year. An official stated, “We would like to
        remind the citizens that the chase for ‘likes’ in social networks can lead to the road
        of death.”
        <br><br>
        In Denver, officials closed a public park in late August after incidents involving
        individuals taking selfies with bears. That echoed an action at Banff National Park in
        Alberta, Canada, where a “bear bulletin” was issued to dissuade tourists from
        taking selfies with the animals alongside the road.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        Earlier in the summer, rangers in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming felt
        compelled to distribute pamphlets with an image of a man being gored and flung
        into the air by a bison. The animals, they noted, are “wild, unpredictable, and
        dangerous.” They also weigh 3,500 pounds and have been clocked at 30 mph.
        Three aborted Yellowstone selfies with bison could have added a new meaning to
        “photo bomb.”
        <br><br>
        A 43-year-old Mississippi woman and her daughter were within 6 yards of a bison
        for their photo op when nature reared its ugly head. According to a park servicestatement, “They heard the bison’s footsteps moving toward them and started to
        run, but the bison caught the mother on the right side, lifted her up and tossed her
        with its head.”
        <br><br>
        She suffered only minor injuries. Other selfie-related incidents involved a 16-yearold Taiwanese girl and a 62-year-old Australian man being gored by bison.
        In San Diego — in an extraordinarily stupid and expensive instance of a selfie — a
        man picked up a rattlesnake from the brush for his photo documentation. The
        snake gashed his arm. It took the anti-venom stock at two hospitals to save him.
        The bill was $153,161.25, including $83,341.25 for pharmacy costs.
        While squirrels on the Wartburg College campus are legendary for their friendliness,
        a selfie with the rodents can pose a risk.
        <br><br>
        A Maine teenager in Florida to check out a college campus saw a squirrel sitting on
        a handrail in a park and took a selfie. The flash from the cellphone scared the
        squirrel, which climbed under his shirt and hung onto his back.
        “I threw myself on the ground, and that scared him off,” said Brian Genest, whose
        mother captured the incident on Instagram.
        <br><br>
        An estimated one million selfies are taken daily. Time Magazine has even ranked
        the Top Selfie Spots in the world — Makati City and Pasig, the Philippines at No. 1,
        followed by Manhattan, Miami and Orange County, Calif.
        Obviously, the vast majority of selfies aren’t hazardous to health — until the
        obsession becomes too adventurous. While the list of selfie-related accidents may
        seem stranger than fiction, the tragedy is that basic precautions to maintain life
        and limb were ignored in pursuit of a photo.

        <a href = https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/2 name = E2 blank style = "text-decoration: none;cursor:pointer;color:gold;">Bring People Back to the River, Des Moines Register Editorial Staff, April 26, 2016</a>

        A Register staffer watched last week as kids played soccer along the banks of the
Des Moines River, near the Rotary Riverwalk Playground. They ran up and down the
bank as the ball rolled to the water’s edge.
Later, the staffer captured the orange ball bobbling below the Center Street Dam,
caught in the rolling water. The children were gone.
All that the dam claimed this time was a ball. It hasn’t always turned out so well.
Since 1900, 12 people have been killed at the Center Street Dam. Three more have
died downstream at the Scott Avenue Dam. Other people were rescued or survived
close calls.
<br><br>
Rarely do we have the chance to improve safety at the same time we can provide
opportunities for recreation and development. Removing or altering the low-head
dams would open a rush of possibilities.
The Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization has unveiled illustrations
showing what the river could look like without the dams. All of the ideas maintain
existing water levels above the Center Street Dam to support upstream recreation
and water treatment.
<br><br>
The drawings (which are anything but set-in-stone plans) show exciting ideas and
attractions. They show different channel options – a lazy river vs. a more
challenging whitewater course, for example – and conditions along the river’s edge
that vary from wild and natural to groomed lawns and concrete landings. But the
most important thing the drawings show may not be immediately obvious: the tiny
dots representing people.
<br><br>
They show people tubing through rapids. And people paddling through gentle drops.
And people walking across boulders to cast a line. And people launching a motor
boat from new access points. And people dining at outdoor cafes and food trucks
near the riverbanks. And people flying kites and watching eagles. And people
gathering at amphitheaters, picnic spots and walkways along the water.
People are drawn toward the water. Over the last 25 years, Des Moines civic and
business leaders have done wonders – creating new parks, trails and other
attractions – to open the river to people, instead of closing it off as it was for
decades.
<br><br>
But the work is incomplete. The two dams create a no-man’s land in the heart of
downtown, along the Principal Riverwalk. Sure, the falling water below the Women
of Achievement Bridge makes a pretty picture. But imagine the photos and videos
of people riding rapids under the same bridge and the attention that would create.
Dams across Iowa once produced power, and removing them is stirring up a
different type of energy. Manchester, Charles City, and Elkader removed dams to
create whitewater parks, which have attracted tourists who want to ride the rapids.
But they’ve also created community gathering places as locals watch the
excitement.
<br><br>
Des Moines could see similar results, but not multiplied. It won’t be cheap. The
Manchester Whitewater Park cost $2.5 million, and removing the two Des Moines
dams and making other changes would cost five or 10 times that.
Before we get hung up on the cost, however, let’s explore the visions for the river.
This process requires people. Get involved and provide input. Let’s imagine the
possibilities – particularly the priceless opportunity for people to enjoy the river
safely.
